SUMMA Clustering for English

# Description
The initial baseline English clustering solution, inspired by Aggarwal and Yu
(2006) was developed by LETA. It is based on TF-IDF feature extraction with
single link hierarchical clustering and constant cut-o  threshold. This
clustering solution has been wrapped in a Docker container and used in the SUMMA
Platform initial releases with promising performance results.
